# Magic Eightball Program
This program was part of a Java programming class (CS 2012 at CSULA)
The structure was given in this exercise:

	Make three classes for this exercise as listed below.
	The MainStart starts the program.
	MainStart uses the class MagicEightBall to make a Pane that it adds to it's BorderPane.
	MagicEightBall uses the class WiseSayings to get strings to print in it's label.

Because we had freedom to design the Eight ball itself, I added a gif to imitate an animation. To not have the animation repeat without the button being pressed, an image that looks identical displayed over the top.
